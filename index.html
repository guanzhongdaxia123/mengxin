                <p> The design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021, at the 100-day
                    countdown ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The concept is based on
                    traditional Chinese
                    astronomy and astrology as the games will be held coinciding with the Chinese New Year
                    festivities.<br>
                    The medal body of this Winter Olympics is
                    composed of a circle and a circle. The image is derived from the ancient Chinese jade bib with
                    concentric circles, with a total of five rings, inheriting the medal design of the 2008 Summer
                    Olympic Games. The front center of the medal is engraved with the Olympic logo, and the full English
                    name of the Winter Olympics "XXIV Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022" is engraved around it. The
                    dented ring is inspired by the traditional string pattern jade bi, and the decorative pattern comes
                    from the traditional Chinese pattern. The center of the back of the medal is engraved with the
                    emblem of the Winter Olympics, and the official Chinese name of the Winter Olympics "Beijing 2022,
                    the 24th Winter Olympic Games" is engraved around it. The 24 points and movement arcs on the circle
                    are inspired by ancient astronomical maps, symbolizing the vast starry sky, the harmony between man
                    and nature, and the athletes shining like stars. The name of the competition item corresponding to
                    the winning athlete is engraved on the outermost ring on the back of the medal.

                            residential area. Therefore, there is a need to build another Olympic Village on a

                <p><b> Bing DwenDwen</b> is the official mascot of the 2022 Winter Olympics, and <b>Shuey
                        RhonRhon</b> is the
                    official
                    mascot of the 2022 Winter Paralympics. <br>
                    A total of 5,816 designs were submitted for further review and ten were shortlisted, the
                    mascots
                    were unveiled on 17 September 2019, Bing DwenDwen and Shuey RhonRhon were selected over
                    eight other hopeful
                    designs. Bing DwenDwen and Shuey RhonRhon were chosen from thousands of Chinese
                    designs in 35 countries worldwide. <br>
                    Bing DwenDwen is a Giant panda with a suit of ice, a heart of gold and a
                    love of all things winter sports. The panda is ready to share the true spirit of the
                    Olympics with the whole
                    world. Shuey RhonRhon is an anthropomorphic Chinese lantern. Lanterns represent harvest,
                    celebration, warmth
                    and light. The wishful shape at the top symbolizes auspicious happiness. The continuous
                    pattern of the dove of
                    peace and the Temple of Heaven symbolize the peaceful friendship and highlights the
                    characteristics of the place
                    where the events are held. The decorative pattern incorporates the traditional Chinese
                    paper-cut art. The snow
                    on the face represents the meaning of "a fall of seasonable snow gives promise of a
                    fruitful
                    year". It also
                    reflects the anthropomorphic design and highlights the mascot's cuteness. Bing DwenDwen
                    was
                    designed by Cao
                    Xue, a chief designer at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, while Shuey RhonRhon was
                    designed

                    undergraduate majoring in product design at the Jilin Art Institute of Design.<br>
